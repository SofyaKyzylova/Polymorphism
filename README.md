# Polymorphism
The program works with two types of objects: a triangle and a circle. A hierarchy of classes has been created: basic class and two inheritors.
The main function works with a list of objects (array, list, sequential STL classes), where the following operations are provided: add an object to the list, remove an object from the list, show the identifier and attributes, characteristics of the object and additional operations. 
The following methods are polymorphic: 
  Moving (changing coordinatesby an amount)
  To scale an object by ratio
  Show shape characteristics
  Show attributes
